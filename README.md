# Capstone Project: Bitcoin vs Traditional Assets & Financial Astrology (2017–2025)

This capstone project analyzes Bitcoin’s historical performance compared to traditional financial assets (S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, and Gold) from 2017 to 2025 using core financial metrics. It also explores the impact of astrological events—such as moon phases, Mercury retrogrades, and eclipses—on Bitcoin’s volatility and returns, evaluating whether astrology-based strategies offer any predictive value or trading edge.

## Key Questions Explored

- How does Bitcoin’s performance compare to SPY, QQQ, and GLD in terms of returns, risk, and drawdowns?
- Has Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional financial assets changed over time?
- Do Mercury retrogrades or lunar/solar eclipses coincide with changes in Bitcoin price behavior?
- Can moon phase trading strategies outperform a buy-and-hold strategy in certain market conditions?

## Analysis Summary

- **Bitcoin Cumulative Returns** (2017–2025): +10,500%  
- **Traditional Assets Returns**: QQQ +460%, SPY +300%, GLD +275%  
- **Volatility**: Bitcoin showed significantly higher rolling 30-day volatility than traditional assets, though it has declined post-2022.

### Astrology Insights
- **Mercury Retrograde**: Slightly higher volatility and mixed return performance—no consistent directional signal.
- **Lunar & Solar Eclipses**: Inconsistent patterns in average returns; some years show opposing trends, but no reliable edge.
- **Moon Phase Trading Strategies**:
  - Reduced drawdowns during bear markets (e.g., 2018, 2022)
  - Outperformed in select years like 2021
  - Underperformed in strong bull markets like 2017

## Conclusion

While Bitcoin has historically outperformed traditional assets, it has done so with much higher volatility and drawdowns. Astrology-based strategies like moon phase trading show some interesting patterns, particularly in reducing losses during bear markets, but lack consistent outperformance. These results should be interpreted as exploratory and not used for trading decisions without further validation.
